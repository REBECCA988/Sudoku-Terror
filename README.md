# Sudoko-Terror
This respository is created for the purpose of our game, Suduko. A well known game that involves numbers and logical thinking.
Group name: RUNTIME TERRORS

Group members: Rebecca Hufkie, Caitlin Ingram, Denise Kondic, Kemoneilwe Matsane, Reitumetse Malope

Group mentor: Lunga Phakathi

Project title: Sudoko-Terror

Project page: https://github.com/REBECCA988/Sudoku-Terror.git

Instructions for use (allowable actions): 
The user will input a username, in which to store their results under. The user will then decide which level they would like to play. The choices are "easy", "intermediate" and "hard". After choosing their level, a grid will be constructed based on the level of difficulty choosen. If "easy" is choosen then a specific number of empty spaces will appear. AS the difficulty increases, the number of empty spaces will also increase.  The user is then able to select a square on the grid where they think a number should be placed. A number may only appear once in a row, column and 3X3 box. There will be valid error checking to ensure that there is no repetition of a number in the same row, column and 3X3 box. The user will continue to play until all squares are filled and in the correct spot. If a incorrect number is inputted, then a indication of a error will be displayed so that the user knows that a different number must be inputted. Once the game is complete and the user has won, their score will be stored in a File. Eventually we will change from using numbers in our game to using nine different symbols. Various features will be added to make our program easy to use, such as a exit button, arrows to switch between screens and buttons to view scoreboards and each users individual results. If our program needs any specific requirements, they will be added to this paragraph as our program is being develoed. 

Tools used: [List and describe any .NET libraries or external tools that you imported for use in your project]

Concepts used: 
Our program will use various concepts that were taught to us throughout tha course of the year. We will use concepts from Computational thinking to problem solve and to plan the design of our code logically and in a good programming manner. We will use algorithms such as the Backtracking algorithm and Brute force algorithm to determine if our grid is valid and how it will be solved. Our program will implement another concepts known as Recursion in order to find the right answer which forms part of the Backtracking algorithm. In order to create the grid, Arrays will be used, more specifically a 2D array because the grid has rows and columns. A way to store data about each users results and information, is to use Files. The Files will store a username, scores and the level at which the game was played. Once we develop our code, we will statrt to build on our foundation and implement different features such as making a custom class to help us access the users information in a more structured way. 

Assumptions: 
The system will run using visual studios on a andriod device, so that it is accessable on your phone. A grid will be made containg empty spaces and filled spaces. At first we will use numbers and then we will adjust our code to have 9 different symbols in which the user can choose from to fill into the empty spaces. The user will be able to click on a square anywhere on the grid, except a default filled square, and input a symbol into the square. The user will conntinue you to do this using logical thinking and methods, such as process of elimination, to complete the puzzle. If the user wishes to keep track of their score, a documentation will be made that stores these results for each individual user.

Limitations: [State ANY limitations concerning what your program cannot do, though those functions may be implied by the nature of the project]
