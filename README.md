# Sudoko-Terror
This respository is created for the purpose of our game, Suduko. A well known game that involves numbers and logical thinking.
Group name: RUNTIME TERRORS

Instructions for use (allowable actions): [Provide DETAILED  instructions on how to run AND interact with your program. If we cannot run it with relative ease, it will NOT be marked! So if it needs to be saved in a specific folder, or needs Internet access, or needs anything beyond simply double clicking the executable, document all that here. This is very IMPORTANT! Also, list all forms of interaction here, so if your program allows the user to press ‘Q’ to exit, or ‘left arrow’ or ‘right arrow’ to do specific things, document that here as well. If we cannot figure out how to interact with your program and nothing is documented, it will NOT be marked!]

Tools used: [List and describe any .NET libraries or external tools that you imported for use in your project]

Concepts used: 
Our program will use various concepts that were taught to us throughout tha course of the year. We will use concepts from Computational thinking to problem solve and to plan the design of our code logically and in a good programming manner. We will use algorithms such as the Backtracking algorithm and Brute force algorithm to determine if our grid is valid and how it will be solved. Our program will implement another concepts known as Recursion in order to find the right answer which forms part of the Backtracking algorithm. In order to create the grid, Arrays will be used, more specifically a 2D array because the grid has rows and columns. A way to store data about each users results and information, is to use Files. The Files will store a username, scores and the level at which the game was played. Once we develop our code, we will statrt to build on our foundation and implement different features such as making a custom class to help us access the users information in a more structured way. 

Assumptions: 
The system will run using visual studios on a andriod device, so that it is accessable on your phone. A grid will be made containg empty spaces and filled spaces. At first we will use numbers and then we will adjust our code to have 9 different symbols in which the user can choose from to fill into the empty spaces. The user will be able to click on a square anywhere on the grid, except a default filled square, and input a symbol into the square. The user will conntinue you to do this using logical thinking and methods, such as process of elimination, to complete the puzzle. If the user wishes to keep track of their score, a documentation will be made that stores these results for each individual user.

Limitations: [State ANY limitations concerning what your program cannot do, though those functions may be implied by the nature of the project]
